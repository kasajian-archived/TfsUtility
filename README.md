Some missing command line utilities for Team Foundation Server 2013
Posted January 1, 2014 · Add Comment
I feel like I’ve been spending my life doing Team Foundation Server migrations and upgrades lately.  (It’s only partially true.)  Anyway, there have been a handful of command line tools for TFS2013 that I’ve wanted and just got around to writing them.

*Here are the features:*

 - List work item folders for a Team Project
 - List work item queries in a folder for a Team Project
 - Export a work item query to the console or to a file
 - Import a work item query from a file to Team Foundation Server
 - List Team Projects in a Team Project Collection (TPC)

Ok.  I’ll admit it.  They’re not the sexiest utilities ever but they’re really handy for restoring work item queries from their original *.wiq files in the process template or copying work item queries between team project.
