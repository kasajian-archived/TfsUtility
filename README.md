# TfsUtility

Based on Benday.TfsUtility-code
From http://www.benday.com/2014/01/01/some-missing-command-line-utilities-for-team-foundation-server-2013/

# What's here:

The library encapsulates some missing command line utilities for Team Foundation Server

*Here are the features:*

New Features I've added:
 - Link a child work-item to a parent (TBD)
 - Query a tree query (TBD)

Features inherited the original 'Benday' implementation
 - List work item folders for a Team Project
 - List work item queries in a folder for a Team Project
 - Export a work item query to the console or to a file
 - Import a work item query from a file to Team Foundation Server
 - List Team Projects in a Team Project Collection (TPC)

# Is this needed?
If anyone knows where there's more official utility that does the same thing (such as updated Microsoft utilities, tfpt.exe, tf.exe, etc.), please let me know so that I can retire functionality from here.
